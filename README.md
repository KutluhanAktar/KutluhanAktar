# Hi 👋

## Independent Researcher | Product, AI, and Software Developer | Maker | Proof-of-Concept Solutions

I am an independent researcher focusing on demonstrating the ideas and solutions I conceptualized regarding various domains and disciplines, from industrial operations to agriculture. In relation to the research subject and the experiments I am conducting, I develop products, neural network models, and distinctive application software. Since I primarily apply the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) methodology so as to develop my solutions, I always collate unique data while generating my datasets and elaborate my data collection techniques in addition to providing the results of my experiments.

Of course, I would not be able to pursue independent research and fulfill my AI-driven solution concepts for real-world problems without the unwavering and continuing support of pioneering tech companies, such as Edge Impulse, DFRobot, Particle, Seeed Studio, PCBWay, and Elecrow. Thanks to their assistance and sponsorships, I was able to utilize state-of-the-art infrastructures, services, and sensors to devise innovative proof-of-concept projects and accomplish my authentic and intricate builds as a full-time occupation.

## ⚠️ Regarding tutorials
> I recently developed my portfolio website — kutluhanaktar.com — from scratch and decided to migrate all of my codebase to GitHub to provide a simple and straightforward experimentation or replication method for my proof-of-concept projects. Nonetheless, since I focused on demonstrating my thought process and experiment results thoroughly in the written tutorial format, including but not limited to PCB designing and dataset construction steps, I could not provide enough information to fully explain my concepts and instructions via GitHub descriptions only. Thus, I added the original publication date and the associated tutorials (on my website and other platforms) to each project description.
